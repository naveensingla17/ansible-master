Ensure that your public SSH key is added to the authorized_keys file on each target host.
1. run ssh-keygen on ansible server
2. copy public key and paste every target servers (cd /root/.ssh; vi authorized_keys)
3. test connection --> ssh <ipaddress>

4. go to ansible server --> 
cd /ansible/ansible_quickstart
vi inventory.ini

[myhosts]
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

run command --> ansible-inventory -i inventory.ini --list (to validate)
ansible myhosts -m ping -i inventory.ini (to validate connection)
