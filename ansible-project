Project 1: 
Step 1: create below inventory file:
######## static inventory file
172.31.23.131
172.31.29.18

[dev]
172.31.23.131
172.31.14.{1..100} # to add series of ip 

[stage]
172.31.29.18

[myserver:children]
dev
stage

Step 2: Create below ansible.cfg file
defaults]
inventory = ./inventory
remote_user = ansible      
ask_pas = False
interpreter_python = /usr/bin/python3.9 

[privilege_escalation]
become = True
become_method = sudo
become_user = root
become_ask_pass = False

Step 3: Run / practice below commands

ansible --list-hosts dev
ansible --list-hosts stage
ansible --list-hosts all
ansible --list-hosts myserver

Note: all commands should be inside the project where inventory and ansible.cfg file exists else give inventory file path as shown below

ansible --list-hosts myserver -i /root/ansible-project/inventory
