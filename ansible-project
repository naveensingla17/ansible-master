Project 1: 
Step 1: create below inventory file:
######## static inventory file
172.31.23.131
172.31.29.18

[dev]
172.31.23.131
172.31.14.{1..100} # to add series of ip 

[stage]
172.31.29.18

[myserver:children]
dev
stage

Step 2: Create below ansible.cfg file
[defaults]
inventory = ./inventory
remote_user = ansible      
ask_pas = False
interpreter_python = /usr/bin/python3.9 

[privilege_escalation]
become = True
become_method = sudo
become_user = root
become_ask_pass = False

Step 3: Run / practice below commands

ansible --list-hosts dev
ansible --list-hosts stage
ansible --list-hosts all
ansible --list-hosts myserver

Note: all commands should be inside the project where inventory and ansible.cfg file exists else give inventory file path as shown below

ansible --list-hosts myserver -i /root/ansible-project/inventory

==> in order to avoid writing below line in ansible..cfg file
inventory = ./inventory

do the following:
go to file --> /root/.bashrc --> add below line
export  ANSIBLE_CONFIG=/root/ansible-project/ansible.cfg
run below command to compile bash profile
source /root/bashrc

==> adhoc commands syntac
  1. How do you validate inventory file ?
    ansible-inventory -i inventory.ini --list

  2 . How do you validate host connection ?
    ansible -m ping all  
    ansible -m ping dev
    ansible -m ping stage  
	  ansible myhosts -m ping -i inventory.ini

  3. How to execude command on remote end clients ?
    Pre-requisite: make sure ansible user is allowed sudo permissions
    ansible -m command -a "uptime" dev
    ansible -m command -a "uptime" stage
    ansible -m command -a "ls -l /" all

    ansible -m shell -a "tail -5 /etc/passwd" dev
    ansible -m shell -a "id ansible" dev
    ansible -m shell -a "df -hT" all

    ansible -m user -a "name=demo1 state=present" dev  ### command to create user
    ansible -m user -a "name=demo1 state=absent" dev  ### to disable user

  4. Show ansible graph ?
     Ans:
[root@master ansible-project]# ansible-inventory --graph
@all:
  |--@ungrouped:
  |--@myserver:
  |  |--@dev:
  |  |  |--172.31.23.131
  |  |--@stage:
  |  |  |--172.31.29.18
[root@master ansible-project]# cat inventory 
172.31.23.131
172.31.29.18

[dev]
172.31.23.131

[stage]
172.31.29.18

[myserver:children]
dev
stage
